# Cove Security

## Mission Statement

My mission is to protect networks from the vast number of bad actors currently profiting from unsuspecting victims. This project has no competition in its price range. Cove learns intricate network traffic patterns and detects novel and known attacks with increasing accuracy as it analyzes and learns a better and better representation of the network.
