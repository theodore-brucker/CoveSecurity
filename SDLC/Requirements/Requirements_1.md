## ML SEC System Requirements

### Project 1: Historical Data Collection and Model Development

#### Task 1: Data Collection
- **Subtask 1.1:** The application must identify and document network traffic data sources, so that relevant data can be acquired.
- **Subtask 1.2:** The application must collect historical network traffic data, so that it can be used for model training.
- **Subtask 1.3:** The application must clean and preprocess collected data, so that the data is suitable for model training and analysis.


#### Task 3: Model Training
- **Subtask 2.3:** The application must normalize and scale data using a scaler, so that data is consistent and comparable.
- **Subtask 3.1:** The application must select appropriate machine learning algorithms, so that the most effective model can be trained.
- **Subtask 3.2:** The application must split data into training, validation, and test sets, so that the model can be properly trained and evaluated.
- **Subtask 3.3:** The application must train the model on the training set, so that it can learn from historical data.
- **Subtask 3.4:** The application must validate the model and fine-tune hyperparameters, so that the model's performance is optimized.

#### Task 4: Model Evaluation
- **Subtask 4.1:** The application must evaluate the model using the test set, so that its effectiveness can be measured.
- **Subtask 4.2:** The application must calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, so that the model's performance can be quantified.
- **Subtask 4.3:** The application must optimize the model based on evaluation results, so that it performs better in production.

### Project 2: Model Serving Infrastructure

#### Task 1: Model Packaging
- **Subtask 1.1:** The application must convert the trained model to a deployable format (e.g., Docker container), so that it can be easily deployed.
- **Subtask 1.2:** The application must include all dependencies in the package, so that the model can function correctly in the deployment environment.

#### Task 2: Deployment Setup
- **Subtask 2.1:** The application must set up a model serving platform (TorchServe), so that the model can be served to end users.
- **Subtask 2.2:** The application must configure the serving environment (e.g., API endpoints, load balancers), so that it can handle requests and serve predictions efficiently.

### Project 3: Data Streaming with Kafka

#### Task 1: Apache Kafka Setup
- The application must set up Kafka for data streaming, so that real-time data can be ingested and processed.

#### Task 2: Low-Latency Streaming
- The application must ensure Kafka setup handles low-latency requirements, so that real-time processing is efficient and timely.

#### Task 3: Data Pipeline Integration
- The application must integrate Kafka with the model serving infrastructure and GUI, so that data flows seamlessly from ingestion to visualization.

### Project 4: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development

#### Task 1: GUI Design
- The application must design the GUI for the application, so that it provides a user-friendly interface.

#### Task 2: GUI Implementation
- **Subtask 2.1:** The application must develop the frontend using React, so that it has a modern and responsive interface.
- **Subtask 2.2:** The application must integrate the frontend with the Flask backend, so that it can interact with the model serving API.
- **Subtask 2.3:** The application must implement real-time updates and visualizations, so that users can see live data and predictions.

#### Task 3: User Testing
- **Subtask 3.1:** The application must conduct usability testing with security professionals, so that feedback can be gathered and improvements made.
- **Subtask 3.2:** The application must gather feedback and make necessary improvements, so that the GUI meets user needs and expectations.
- **Subtask 3.3:** The application must ensure the GUI meets performance and user experience standards, so that it is efficient and easy to use.

### Project 5: Integration and Testing

#### Task 1: System Integration
- **Subtask 1.1:** The application must integrate all components (model, serving infrastructure, data streaming, GUI), so that they work together seamlessly.
- **Subtask 1.2:** The application must ensure seamless data flow and interaction between components, so that the system operates smoothly.

#### Task 2: End-to-End Testing
- **Subtask 2.1:** The application must develop test cases for end-to-end functionality, so that the system can be thoroughly tested.
- **Subtask 2.2:** The application must conduct integration tests to validate system performance, so that any issues can be identified and resolved.
- **Subtask 2.3:** The application must identify and fix any issues or bottlenecks, so that the system is reliable and performs well.

#### Task 3: Security and Compliance Testing
- **Subtask 3.1:** The application must conduct security audits and penetration testing, so that it is secure and free from vulnerabilities.
- **Subtask 3.2:** The application must ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards, so that it meets all legal and industry requirements.

### Project 6: Deployment and Maintenance

#### Task 1: Deployment Planning
- **Subtask 1.1:** The application must create a deployment plan and timeline, so that deployment is well-organized and timely.
- **Subtask 1.2:** The application must set up staging and production environments, so that the system can be tested and deployed correctly.
- **Subtask 1.3:** The application must conduct final checks and prepare for launch, so that deployment goes smoothly.

#### Task 2: Production Deployment
- **Subtask 2.1:** The application must deploy the system to the production environment, so that it is available to users.
- **Subtask 2.2:** The application must monitor the system post-deployment, so that any issues can be quickly addressed.
